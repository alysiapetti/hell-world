# hello-world
Just another repo


Hello all!

My name is Alysia, this is my first attempt at using GitHub since starting classes and code with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and learning Ruby on Rails currently to add to my languages. I have two cats, Boots and Jager, who love to distract me often and enjoy playing League of Legends with friends. I look forward to contributing to projects and improving not only my own syntax, but other's if I can so we all can code 'less for more'.
